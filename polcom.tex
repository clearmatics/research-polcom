\begin{document} \sloppy \maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  In this paper we investigate properties of zkSNARKs obtained by
  compiling a PIOP proof using a polynomial commitment scheme. The question we
  try to answer is \say{What polynomial commitment's properties propagate to
    the resulting zkSNARK?}. The properties we focus on are:
  \begin{compactenum}
  \item simulation extractability,
  \item SRS updatability,
  \item SRS-updatable simulation extractability,
  \item subversion zero knowledge.
  \end{compactenum}
  The research hypothesis is \say{A NIZK obtained from a simulation extractable /
    SRS-updatable / SRS updatable SE / subversion zero knowledge polynomial
    commitment is simulation extractable /
    SRS-updatable / SRS updatable SE / subversion zero knowledge.} To be able to
  show the hypothesis we need to solve a number of problems
  \begin{compactenum}
  \item Neither simulation extractability, SRS-updatability, SRS-updatable
    simulation extractability, nor subversion zero knowledge have been defined
    for a polynomial commitment scheme. Another contribution of the paper is
    defining these properties. 
  \item Similarly, there is no definition for SRS-updatable simulation
    extractable NIZKs.
  \item The polynomial IOP is defined very generally, cf.~\cref{def:piop}, what
    makes showing generic properties difficult. The paper would propose tighter
    definitions which would emphasize more the structure of PIOP,
    but would not narrow a class of possible (from the practical point of view)
    PIOPs too much, cf.~\cref{def:wepiop,def:sdwepiop}.
  \end{compactenum}

\paragraph{Polynomial commitment scheme.}
\label{sec:poly_com}
In the polynomial commitment scheme $\PCOM = (\kgen, \com, \open, \verify)$ the
prover $\prover$ convinces the verifier $\verifier$ that some polynomial $\p{f}$
which $\prover$ committed to evaluates to $s$ at some point $z$ chosen by
$\verifier$.  The key generation algorithm $\kgen$ takes as input a security
parameter $\secparam$ and a parameter $\maxdeg$ which determines the maximal
degree of the committed polynomial. We assume that $\maxdeg$ can be read from
the output SRS.
  
We emphasize the following properties of a secure polynomial commitment
$\PCOM$:
\begin{description}
\item[Evaluation binding:] A $\ppt$ adversary $\adv$ which outputs a commitment
  $\vec{c}$ and evaluation points $\vec{z}$ has at most negligible chances to
  open the commitment to two different evaluations $\vec{s}, \vec{s'}$. That is,
  let $k \in \NN$ be the number of committed polynomials, $l \in \NN$ number of
  evaluation points, $\vec{c} \in \GRP^k$ be the commitments,
  $\vec{z} \in \FF_p^l$ be the arguments the polynomials are evaluated at,
  $\vec{s},\vec{s}' \in \FF_p^k$ the evaluations, and
  $\vec{o},\vec{o}' \in \FF_p^l$ be the commitment openings. Then for every
  $\ppt$ adversary $\adv$
	\[
		\Pr
			\left[
			\begin{aligned}
				& \verify(\srs, \vec{c}, \vec{z}, \vec{s}, \vec{o}) = 1,  \\ 
				& \verify(\srs, \vec{c}, \vec{z}, \vec{s}', \vec{o}') = 1, \\
				& \vec{s} \neq \vec{s}'
			\end{aligned}
			\,\left|\,\vphantom{\begin{aligned}
                  & \\
                  & \\
                  &
                \end{aligned}}
			\begin{aligned}
				& \srs \gets \kgen(\secparam, \maxdeg),\\
				& (\vec{c}, \vec{z}, \vec{s}, \vec{s}', \vec{o}, \vec{o}') \gets \adv(\srs)
			\end{aligned}
			\right.\right] \leq \negl\,.
	\]

\end{description}
	

\begin{description}
\item[Commitment of knowledge] For every $\ppt$ adversary $\adv$ who produces
  commitment $c$, gets random evaluation point $z$, and outputs evaluation $s$
  with an opening $o$ there exists a $\ppt$ extractor $\ext$ such that
\[
  \Pr \left[
    \begin{aligned}
      & \p{f} = \ext_\adv(\srs, c; r),\\
      & c = \com(\srs, \p{f}),\\
      & \verify(\srs, c, z, s, o) = 1
    \end{aligned}
    \,\left|\,
      \vphantom{
        \begin{aligned}
          & \\
          & \\
          &
        \end{aligned}
        }
    \begin{aligned}
      & \srs \gets \kgen(\secparam, \maxdeg),\\
      & (c, z, s, o) \gets \adv(\srs; r)
    \end{aligned}
  \right.\right]
  \geq 1 - \epsk(\secpar).
\]
In that case we say that $\PCOM$ is $\epsk$-knowledge.
\end{description}
Intuitively when a commitment scheme is a commitment of knowledge then if an
adversary produces a (valid) commitment $c$, which it can open, then it also
knows the underlying polynomial $\p{f}$ which commits to that value.

\begin{definition}[Simulation extractable polynomial commitment]
  \label{def:sepcom}
  Let $\PCOM$ be a polynomial commitment scheme, let $\oracles$ be an 
  oracle which on input
  \begin{description}
%   \item [$(\msg{commit}, f)$:] returns commitment $c = \com(f)$ and adds $(f,
% c)$ to list $Q$.
\item[$(\msg{commit}, f, d)$:] for $\deg(f) = d'$, $d' \leq d \leq \maxdeg$,
  picks $d - d'$ random elements $r_1, \ldots, r_{d - d'}$, sets 
  polynomial $g(X) = f(X) + r_1 X^{d' + 1} + \ldots + r_{d - d'} X^{d}$, returns
  commitment $c = \com(g)$ and adds $(g, c)$ to list $\Qcom$.
  \item[$(\msg{evaluate}, c, z)$:] returns $f(z)$ where $f$ is a polynomial
    which commitment is $c$ and $(f, c) \in \Qcom$; add $z$ to $\Qev$.
  \item[$(\msg{open}, c, x, y)$:] returns an opening $o$ for commitment $c$
    assuring that for some polynomial $f$, such that $c \in \image(\com(f))$,
    holds $f(x) = y$.
  \end{description}
  We say that $\PCOM$ is \emph{simulation extractable} if for any $\ppt$
  adversary $\adv$ with oracle access to $\oracles$ there exists extractor
  $\ext$ such that
\[
  \Pr \left[
    \begin{aligned}
      & \p{f} = \ext_\adv(\srs, c; r),\\
      & c = \com(\srs, \p{f}),\\
      & \verify(\srs, c, z, s, o) = 1,\\
      & z \not\in \Qev
    \end{aligned}
    \,\left|\,
      \vphantom{
        \begin{aligned}
          & \\
          & \\
          & \\
          &
        \end{aligned}
        }
    \begin{aligned}
      & \srs \gets \kgen(\secparam, \maxdeg),\\
      & (c, z, s, o) \gets \adv^{\oracles}(\srs; r), \\
      % & z \sample \FF,\\
      % & (s, o) \gets \adv^{\oracles}(\srs, z; r)
    \end{aligned}
  \right.\right]
  \geq 1 - \epsk(\secpar).
\]

    polynomial? That is how $\ext$ in a proof system works -- it evaluates
    polynomials submitted by the adversary on multiple challenges.}
 \end{definition}

 \begin{definition}[Rational SE PCOM]
   \label{def:rational_sepcom}
   We call a simulation extractable polynomial commitment $\PCOM$
   \emph{rational} if $\oracles$ on input $(\msg{commit}, f, d)$ accepts $f$
   being a rational function (not only a polynomial).
 \end{definition}

 \begin{definition}[$f$-SE PCOM]
   \label{def:f_sepcom}
   We call a simulation extractable polynomial commitment $\PCOM$ $f$-simulation
   extractable if $\oracles$ accepts input
   $(\msg{operate}, f, c_1, \ldots, c_k)$. On that input, $\oracles$ retrieves
   polynomials $f_1, \ldots, f_k$ which are committed in $c_1, \ldots, c_k$, 
   returns $c = \com(f(f_1, \ldots, f_k))$, and adds $(f(f_1, \ldots, f_k), c)$
   to $\Qcom$.
 \end{definition}

 \begin{definition}[\hl{Good name needed}]
   We call a commitment scheme $\PCOM$ \hl{good name needed} if any $\adv$ who
   outputs commitments $c_1, \ldots, c_k$, evaluation point $z$, evaluations
   $s_1, \ldots, s_k$ and batch opening $o$, which certifies that polynomials
   $f_i$ evaluates at $z$ to $s_i$ and $c_i \in \image(\com(f_i))$, can also
   produce valid openings $o_i$ for each triple $(c_i, z, s_i)$.
 \end{definition}
 \michals{23.06}{That's easy for KZG batched as in Plonk (with minor difference)
 -- just get a number of batch openings and do Gaussian elimination.}

 \begin{definition}[Sufficiently simulatable PCOM]
   Let $\PCOM$ be a SE polynomial commitment scheme and
   $\PS = (\kgen, \prover, \verfier, \simulator)$ a zero-knowledge proof system
   for relation $\REL$. We call $\PCOM$ \emph{sufficiently simulatable for
     $\PS$} if there exist a $\ppt$ algorithm $\adv$ such that for
   $\srs \sample \kgen$, all $(\inp, \wit) \in \REL$ holds
   \[
     \SD_{\srs \sample \kgen(\secparam)}(\prover(\srs, \inp, \wit),
     \adv^{\oracles}(\srs, \inp)).
   \]
 \end{definition}
 Intuitively, we call $\PCOM$ sufficiently simulatable for $\PS$ if a $\ppt$
 $\adv$ given access to $\PCOM$'s simulator oracle $\oracles$ can produce a
 simulated proof for $\PS$.

 \begin{definition}[Polynomial IOP,~\cite{EPRINT:Szepieniec20}]
  \label{def:piop}
  Let $\REL$ be an indexed relation with a corresponding language $\LANG$, $\FF$
  some finite field, and $\maxdeg$ a degree bound and $\noofp$ a parameter. A
  \emph{polynomial IOP for $\REL$ with degree bound $\maxdeg$} is a pair of
  interactive machines $\prover, \verifier$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $(\prover, \verifier)$ is an interactive proof for $\LANG$ with $r$ rounds
  and soundness error $\epss$;
\item $\prover$ sends to $\verifier$ polynomials $f_i \in \FF[X]$,
  $i \in \range{1}{\noofp}$, of degree at most $\maxdeg$;
\item $\verifier$ is an oracle machine with access to a list of oracles, which
  contains one oracle for each polynomial it has received from the prover;
\item When an oracle associated with a polynomial $f_i(X)$ is queried on a point
  $z_j \in \FF$, the oracle responds with the value $f_i(z_j)$; 
\item $\verifier$ sends challenges $\alpha_k \in \FF$ to $\prover$;
\item $\verifier$ is public coin.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Witness encoding PIOP (WEPIOP)]
  \label{def:wepiop}
  Let $\PS$ be a PIOP.  We say that $\PS$ is \emph{witness encoding} if there is
  a function $\decode$ and set $\encset \in [\noofp]$ such that for any
  $(\inp, \wit) \in \REL$ and polynomials $\smallset{f_i}_{i \in [\noofp]}$ sent by an
  honest prover, $\decode(\smallset{f_i}_{i \in \encset}) = \wit$. We call $\encset$ the
  \emph{encoding set}.
\end{definition}
In other words, PIOP is witness encoding if for any valid proof for a statement
$\inp$ in the language, the corresponding witness can be read from the
polynomial coefficients. We note that this is the case for virtually all
PIOPs. \michals{28.04}{Check!}]

\begin{definition}[Somehow deterministic WEPIOP]
  \label{def:sdwepiop}
  Let $\PS$ be a WEPIOP for $\REL$. For each polynomial $f_i$ sent by the prover
  denote by $A_i$ the set of challenges sent by the verifier and by $F_i$ the
  set of polynomials sent by the prover \emph{before} the prover sends
  $f_i$. Let $\encset$ be an encoding set. We say that $\PS$ is \emph{somehow
    deterministic} (SD) if for any $(\inp, \wit) \in \REL$, polynomials
  $\smallset{f_i}_{i \in [\noofp]}$ send by the prover, and encoding set
  $\encset \neq [\noofp]$ each polynomial
  $f_j \in \smallset{f_i}_{i \in [\noofp] \setminus \encset}$ is determined by
  \begin{itemize}
    \item polynomials $F_j$, and
    \item the verifier's challenges $A_i$, and
    \item the witness $\wit$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
Intuitively, we say that WEPIOP is somehow deterministic if the only
non-deterministic messages send by the prover are polynomials encoding the
witness, and all other messages are determined by the previous one, witness, and
verifier's challenges.

\begin{lemma}
  Let $\PS = (\PS.\prover, \PS.\verifier)$ be a PIOP with knowledge soundness error
  $\epsks$ where the prover sends up to $\noofp$ polynomials. Let $\PCOM$ be a
  knowledge polynomial commitment scheme with extraction error $\epsext$. Let
  $\PSc = (\PSc.\prover, \PSc.\verifier)$ be a proof system such that
  \begin{description}
  \item[$\PSc.\prover$] acts as $\PS.\prover$, except
    \begin{itemize}
    \item when $\PS.\prover$ sets up a polynomial oracle $\oracleo_f$,
      $\PSc.\prover$ sends commitment $c = \com(f)$;
    \item when $\PSc.\verifier$ asks $\PSc.\prover$ to open a commitment
      $c = \com(f)$ at $z$ it returns $f(z)$ and a proof $o$ of correctness of
      the opening.
  \end{itemize}
  \item[$\PSc.\verifier$] acts as $\PS.\verifier$, except when $\PS.\verifier$
    asks oracle $\oracleo_f$ for an evaluation of $f$ at $z$, $\PSc.\verifier$
    sends $z$ to $\PSc.\prover$ and expects $f(z)$ in return.
  \end{description}
  Then $\PSc$ is knowledge sound with knowledge error at most $\epsks + \noofp \cdot \epsext$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\adv$ be an adversary that breaks knowledge soundness of $\PSc$ with
  probability $\eps$ greater than $\epsks + \noofp \cdot \epsext$.  We build
  $\bdv$ that breaks knowledge soundness of $\PS$ with probability greater than
  $\epsks$. More precisely, let $\ext_\adv$ be an extractor for $\adv$ and
  $\ext_\bdv$ be an extractor for $\bdv$. We show that if $\adv$ produces an
  instance and proof such that $\ext_\adv$ fails to extract the corresponding
  witness, then $\bdv$ produces an instance and proof that $\ext_\bdv$ fails as well.

  $\bdv$ starts by picking an SRS $\srs$ for the polynomial commitment scheme
  $\PCOM$ and provides $\srs$ to $\adv$. Let $\ext^{\PCOM}_\adv$ be a polynomial
  commitment extractor for $\adv$ that for any commitment $c$ produced by $\adv$
  outputs polynomial $f$ such that $c \in \image(\com(f))$, except with
  probability $\epsext$.  Let $\inp$ be the instance $\adv$ creates a proof
  for. Each time $\adv$ sends a commitment $c$, $\bdv$ uses $\ext^{\PCOM}_\adv$
  to extract polynomial $f$ from $c$ and sends $f$ to a newly set oracle
  $\oracleo_f$.  \michals{5.5}{how much we can generalize here?  I.e.~could we
    have a single proof that would cover algebraic adversaries that returns with
    $c$ also a vector of group elements' logarithms; or commitment schemes where
    there is an extraction key $k$ allowing to extract $f$ from $c$?}  Each time
  $\PS.\verifier$ sends a challenge $\alpha$, $\bdv$ passes $\alpha$ to $\adv$
  as $\PSc.\verifier$'s challenge. Note that $\PS.\verifier$ expects an oracle
  for some (challenge-dependent) polynomial $f$ as an answer, thus $\adv$
  replies with a commitment to some polynomial $f'$. $\bdv$ extracts $f'$ and
  sets a new oracle for it.  When $\PS.\verifier$ queries some oracle
  $\oracleo_f$ at $z$ to learn $f(z)$, $\bdv$ replies with $f(z)$, sends $z$
  to $\adv$ and gets $y$. If $\adv$ provides $y \neq f(z)$, then $\bdv$ aborts
  the proof. Importantly, that may happen with probability $\epsev$ only as an
  acceptable proof from $\adv$ would require breaking evaluation binding
  property of $\PCOM$. 
  
  Eventually, $\adv$ finalizes its proof for $\inp$. Note that
  if $\PSc.\verifier$ accepts the proof provided by $\adv$, then $\PS.\verifier$
  accepts the proof provided by $\bdv$.

  Probability that $\bdv$ \emph{fails} is upper-bounded by three events. One is
  that $\adv$ fails to provide a convincing proof such that $\ext_\adv$ does not
  output a corresponding witness. Probability of this event is upper-bounded by
  $(1 - \eps)$. Another is that $\adv$ breaks evaluation binding property of the
  commitment scheme, since $\verifier$ makes up to $\noofev$ evaluations, that
  happens with probability at most $\noofev \cdot \epsev$ Furthermore, $\bdv$
  may fail to extract some of the polynomials which $\adv$ made commitments
  for. Since $\adv$ commits to $\noofp$ polynomials and $\bdv$ fails to extract
  each of them with probability at most $\epsext$, by the union bound $\bdv$
  fails to extract \emph{some} of the polynomials with probability upper-bounded
  by $\noofp \cdot \epsext$.

  Note that if $\adv$ manages to output an instance $\inp$ and proof $\zkproof$
  that extractor $\ext_\adv$ fails to produce a corresponding witness $\wit$,
  then $\ext_\bdv$ also fails to produce a witness for the instance output by
  $\bdv$. This comes from the simple observation, if $\ext_\bdv$ was successful,
  then $\ext_\adv$ could run $\bdv$ internally along with $\adv$ until the former
  outputs instance $\inp$ and proof $\zkproof'$, then use $\ext_\bdv$ to extract
  witness $\wit$ for $\inp$. Importantly, both $\adv$ and $\bdv$ output the same instance.

  Hence the probability of $\bdv$'s failure in generating a proof for instance
  $\inp$ that $\ext_\bdv$ fails to extract a correct witness is upper-bounded by
  \[
    (1 - \eps) + \noofp \cdot \epsext.
  \]
  Hence, for $\eps > \epsks + \noofp \cdot \epsext$ adversary $\bdv$ wins with probability at least
  \[
    \epsks + \noofp \cdot \epsext - \noofp \cdot \epsext  = \epsks.
  \]
  \qed
